# Summit FAQ
Frequently asked questions related to the Summit high-performance computing (HPC) system of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

- How do I set up my GitHub repository (i.e. working codebase) on Summit?
  - If you will be working on the project (mostly) by yourself, you will want to keep all of your project files and data in the "Member Work" partition of Summit. You can access this partition by executing the command "cd $MEMBERWORK" from your home directory (i.e. the one at which you initially land when you log into Summit).
  - From there, you will be greeted with a directory for all the projects for which you applied (and were approved by ORNL staff). Once you "cd" into the directory of the project on which you are currently working, you can create your project directory structure(s) as you see fit.

- How do I create Conda environments on Summit?
